# zero-length files. Write the names of all zero-length files to standard output. If there is no option on the command line,
# have the script delete the file after displaying its name, asking the user for confirmation, and receiving positive confirmation.
# A â€“f (force) option on the command line indicates that the script should display the filename but not ask for confirmation before
# deleting the file.
